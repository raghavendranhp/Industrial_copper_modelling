# Industrial Copper Modeling

### Domain: Manufacturing

üîó **Live App**: [Streamlit App](https://industrialcoppermodelling-ragha22.streamlit.app/)

---

## üìå Problem Statement

The copper industry often grapples with noisy, skewed sales and pricing data, making manual prediction and analysis inefficient and inaccurate. Additionally, the challenge of identifying quality leads based on sales status adds complexity to decision-making. This project aims to:

* Build a **Regression Model** to predict the continuous variable `Selling_Price`.
* Develop a **Classification Model** to predict lead conversion status (`WON` or `LOST`).
* Create an **interactive Streamlit web application** to allow users to input features and get real-time predictions for either task.

## üóÇÔ∏è Dataset Description

The dataset contains information on copper product sales including transactional, customer, and product specifications.

| Feature         | Description                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`            | Unique identifier for each record                    |
| `item_date`     | Transaction date                                     |
| `quantity tons` | Quantity sold (in tons)                              |
| `customer`      | Customer identifier                                  |
| `country`       | Customer country                                     |
| `status`        | Status of deal (e.g., WON, LOST)                     |
| `item type`     | Type of item sold                                    |
| `application`   | Application code for item                            |
| `thickness`     | Thickness of the item                                |
| `width`         | Width of the item                                    |
| `material_ref`  | Material reference code                              |
| `product_ref`   | Product reference code                               |
| `delivery date` | Delivery date                                        |
| `selling_price` | Selling price of the product (Target for Regression) |

## üîç Approach

### 1. Data Understanding

* Identified variable types (categorical/continuous)
* Treated anomalies in `material_ref` (e.g., values starting with `00000`)
* Handled reference columns as categorical features

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Imputed missing values using statistical techniques (mean/median)
* Handled outliers via **IQR method** and **Isolation Forest**
* Treated skewness with **log transformation** and **Box-Cox**
* Encoded categorical variables using **One-Hot** and **Label Encoding**

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualized skewness and outliers using `Seaborn` (boxplot, violinplot)
* Correlation heatmaps to drop highly correlated features

### 4. Feature Engineering

* Created new informative features when needed
* Dropped redundant or highly correlated features

### 5. Model Building

#### Regression:

* Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) used due to data non-linearity and noise
* Target: `selling_price`
* Evaluation Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ Score

#### Classification:

* Models: Logistic Regression, ExtraTreesClassifier, XGBClassifier
* Target: `status` (filtered for `WON`, `LOST`)
* Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC

### 6. Streamlit Application

* Choose task: Regression or Classification
* Input fields for all feature columns (excluding target)
* Model predictions displayed instantly
* Behind the scenes:

  * Applied same preprocessing (scaling, encoding, transformation)
  * Loaded trained models using `pickle`
